### To use these files follow these steps :

1. Use the `data.sql` file for MySql to create the `prod` and the `test` databases with their necessary data.
2. Create a new database with MongoDB and name it `prod` then name it's collection `notes`, after that you can use the `notes.json` file with that collection.
3. To create the `test` database with MongoDB just create it with the same collection name as `step 2` then leave it without any data.
